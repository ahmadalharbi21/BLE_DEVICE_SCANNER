<h1>BLE Device Scanner</h1> <p>The BLE Device Scanner is a Python-based desktop application that allows you to discover and interact with nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the services, characteristics, and properties of BLE peripherals.</p> <h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Scan for nearby BLE devices</strong> <p>Easily scan for nearby BLE devices and display them in a list.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Display services, characteristics, and properties</strong> <br> <img src="images/app_UI.png" alt="Display services, characteristics, and properties" width="400"> <p>Explore the services, characteristics, and properties of connected BLE devices.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>BLE Concepts</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Service</strong> <p>A service is a collection of related characteristics that define a specific functionality of a BLE device. Services are identified by a unique UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).</p> </li> <li> <strong>Characteristic</strong> <p>A characteristic is a data value that belongs to a specific service. It represents a particular aspect or data point of the service. Characteristics are also identified by a unique UUID.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Property</strong> <p>Properties define the permissions and capabilities of a characteristic. They indicate whether a characteristic can be read, written, notified, or indicated.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Value</strong> <p>The value is the actual data stored in a characteristic. It can be read from or written to a characteristic, depending on its properties.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Installation</h2> <ol> <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/ahmadalharbi21/BLE_DEVICE_SCANNER.git</code></li> <li>Install the required dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li> </ol> <h2>Usage</h2> <ol> <li>Run the application: <code>python main.py</code></li> <li>Click the "Scan" button to discover nearby BLE devices</li>  <li>Explore the services, characteristics, and properties of the connected device</li> </ol> <h2>Dependencies</h2> <ul> <li>Python 3.x</li> <li>bleak library</li> <li>Pillow</li><li>Customtkinter</li> </ul> <h2>Contributing</h2> <p>Contributions are welcome!
